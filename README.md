Sparkle Salon V2.0 is an elegant web application designed to provide a seamless online presence for a beauty salon. With a focus on user experience, the application integrates Google reviews, allowing clients to easily share and read feedback. The front-end styling is meticulously crafted using Sass, with scripts set up to watch and compile stylesheets in real-time during development.

The back-end is powered by Express, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, ensuring robust server-side functionality. The application views are rendered with EJS, a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript, providing a dynamic and flexible way to present content.

Development efficiency is enhanced through a series of npm scripts that streamline the workflow, including:

watch:sass: Watches for changes in Sass files and compiles them to CSS.
devserver: Utilizes Nodemon for automatic server restarts upon file changes.
build:css: A comprehensive script that compiles, concatenates, prefixes, and compresses CSS files, ensuring optimal styling performance across various browsers.
The project is authored by Mike Berrio, who has chosen the ISC license for its simplicity and permissiveness. The version 1.0.0 marks the initial stable release of this sophisticated application.
